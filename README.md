# Matrix Manipulations

Matrix Manipulations is a library for storing numerical data as mathematical matrices. It provides common matrix routines, such as matrix multiplication, yet it has several unique features, such as accessing submatrices. This project continuously adds support for common matrix operations and software featrues by iterating through a sequence of machine learning application problems.

## Getting Started

Getting started is simple: simply download and include the files you want in your C++ code.

## Running the tests

The makefile includes all you need to run tutorial.exe, which is the latest version of the test suite. Example1.exe shows a practical example for using this library in an application problem that involves predicting profit by fitting a line through a data set using a gradient descent algorithm to find the fit parameters.
